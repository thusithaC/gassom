the files template_online_soft,template_online and template_batch have been tested on windows.
You will need the mat files IMAGES_TRAIN, Batch_data_single and Batch_data to run the examples.

The image interpolation interpolation is done using http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/20342-image-interpolation--ba-interp2-.
Therefore this package would also be needed. For windows, the compiled mex files are included. 


The binaries could be downloaded from

set the path in the template files to the binaries before running the code.
